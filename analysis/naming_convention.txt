There are three types of files.
tests, test_results, and plot_data.

There are three types of tests: For quantifier depth, for constant size and for junction count.

depth has the following naming convention:
name = depth_<position>_<range_start>_<range_stop>_<constant_size>_<variable_count>_<junction_count>_<mode>_<sample_size>
    where position is either "inside" or "outside"
          range_start and range_stop are the range of the quantifier depth
          constant_size is the midpoint of the interval of the constant in the expression
          variable_count is the number of variables in the expression
          junction_count is the number of junctions in the expression
          mode is either "random", "or" or "and"
          sample_size is the number of samples to be taken
accordingly the files are named
plots: <y-axis>_vs_{name}_<data_filter>
    where y-axis is either "time" or "states"
    where data_filter is "raw", "outlier", "collapsed" or "both"
test_results: results_{name}.csv
tests: test_{name}.csv

constant has the following naming convention:
name = constant_<variable_count>_<junction_count>_<mode>_<sample_size>
    where variable_count is the number of variables in the expression
          junction_count is the number of junctions in the expression
          mode is either "random", "or" or "and"
          sample_size is the number of samples to be taken
accordingly the files are named
plots: <y-axis>_vs_{name}_<data_filter>
    where y-axis is either "time" or "states"
    where data_filter is "raw", "outlier", "collapsed" or "both"
test_results: results_{name}.csv
tests: test_{name}.csv

junction has the following naming convention:
name = junctions_<variable_count>_<constant_size>_<mode>_<sample_size>
    where variable_count is the number of variables in the expression
          constant_size is the midpoint of the interval of the constant in the expression
          mode is either "random", "or" or "and"
          sample_size is the number of samples to be taken
accordingly the files are named
plots: <y-axis>_vs_{name}_<data_filter>
    where y-axis is either "time" or "states"
    where data_filter is "raw", "outlier", "collapsed" or "both"
test_results: results_{name}.csv
tests: test_{name}.csv
